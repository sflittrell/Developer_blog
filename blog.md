# My journey from Electrician to Web Developer

## This blog should be helpful for beginners, because it's written by a beginner. 

  My first week in the remote portion of the bootcamp is more than what I thought it was going to be. <br>
There is a lot of information and I have trouble keeping from diving too deep. I'm still working on finding <br>
my routine and staying on top of the work load. My schedule was altered yesterday because I felt like I fell behind, so <br>
after my kids went to bed, I stayed up pretty late and worked on the excercises for Git. With my time, I try <br>
and work for 50 minutes and break for 10. So far, I feel like those are my greatest struggles.<br>

<br>
I'm eager to be able to put it all together and work seamlesly with all of these tools. Having the ability to <br>
unleash my creativity and build something that is helpful for others is what I aim to do.
